The primary focus of my PhD thesis has been on the modeling, design, and analysis of
nanophotonic and plasmonic devices for programmable and sensor applications. The main
contributions of this thesis can be categorized into eight sections based on the material
presented in the preceding chapters: 1) the design and analysis of tunable Power Splitter
based on an electro-optic slotted ring resonator, 2) the development of integrated plasmonic
digital to analog converter based on broadband low-loss hybrid plasmonic switches having
TCO layers, 3) the study of long-range hybrid plasmonic waveguides with graphene-based
electrical tuning of propagation length, 4) the development of integrated non-volatile
plasmonic switches based on phase-change-materials and their application to plasmonic logic
circuits, 5) the design low loss, broadband, and non-volatile 'directed logic operations' using
phase change materials in silicon photonics, 6) the numerical modeling of integrated non-
volatile reflector switch and mode converter switch for SiN platform based on a low loss
phase change material (Sb2Se3 ), 7) the investigation of extremely large near-field
enhancements in the vicinity of plasmonic nanoantennas on top of bullâ€™s eye structures
exhibiting the extraordinary transmission of light, 8) the design and analysis of high near-
field enhancement in the vicinity of a hybridized nanoaperture-grating structures for SERS
based sensor.
