abstract: Integrated photonic devices or circuits that can execute both optical
  computation and optical data storage are considered as the building blocks for
  photonic computations beyond the von Neumann architecture. Here, we present
  non-volatile hybrid electro-optic plasmonic switches as well as novel
  architectures of non-volatile combinational and sequential logic circuits. The
  electro-optic switches consist of a plasmonic waveguide having a thin layer of
  a phase-change-material (PCM). The optical losses in the waveguide are
  controlled by changing the phase of the PCM from amorphous to crystalline and
  vice versa. The phase transition process in the PCM can be realized by
  electrical threshold switching or thermal conduction heating via external
  electrical heaters or the plasmonic waveguide metal itself as an integrated
  heater. We have demonstrated that all logic gates, a half adder circuit, as
  well as sequential circuits can be implemented using the plasmonic switches as
  the active elements. Moreover, the designs of the plasmonic switches and the
  logic operations show minimum extinction ratios greater than 20 dB, compact
  designs, low operating power, and high-speed operations. We combine photonics,
  plasmonics and electronics on the same platform to design an effective
  architecture for logic operations.
