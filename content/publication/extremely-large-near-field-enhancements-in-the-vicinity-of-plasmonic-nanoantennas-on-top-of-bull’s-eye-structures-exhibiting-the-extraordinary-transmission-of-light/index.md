abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the optical electromagnetic fields
  in the vicinity of plasmonic nanoantennas are substantially enhanced on
  combining the plasmonic nanoantennas with bull’s eye structures (BESs) as
  compared to those of isolated plasmonic nanoantennas or of isolated bull’s eye
  structures. The optical electromagnetic fields are transmitted with high field
  enhancement through the subwavelength apertures of the BESs at the resonance
  wavelength, owing to the extraordinary transmission (EOT) of light. By
  hybridization of the two plasmonic nanoresonators (nanoantennas and BESs),
  optical energy is coupled to the nanoantennas from the light transmitted
  through the BESs. This coupling of light energy to the nanoantennas in the
  transmission mode using EOT and strong near-field enhancement in the vicinity
  of the gap between the nanoantennas integrated with the BESs has been analyzed
  numerically using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We
  optimized the geometrical parameters of both BESs and nanoantenna structures
  for achieving the highest possible near-field enhancement. The resonance
  wavelength of this combined plasmonic structure can easily be tuned from
  visible to the near-infrared range by varying the periodicity of the BESs.
  Employing the proposed hybrid nanostructure consisting of a BES coupled to a
  plasmonic nanoantenna, an electric field enhancement of more than 1000 (i.e.
  an intensity enhancement greater than 1 × 106) is achieved for a 10 nm gap
  between the two arms of the bowtie nanoantenna, of more than 4000 (i.e. an
  intensity enhancement greater than 1.6 × 107) for a 5 nm gap, and of more than
  9000 (i.e. an intensity enhancement greater than 8.1 × 107) for a 2.5 nm gap.
  These values of electric field enhancement are substantially higher than what
  have been reported previously. In this paper, we also present a comparison of
  the near-field enhancements in the vicinity of plasmonic bowtie nanoantennas
  coupled to different types of plasmonic nanogratings—two-dimensional nanohole
  arrays in plasmonic thin films, nanoline arrays in plasmonic thin films, or
  subwavelength apertures in plasmonic thin films surrounded by concentric
  periodic grooves. Moreover, we provide a comparison of the electric field
  enhancements in the vicinity of different types of plasmonic nanoantennas
  coupled to plasmonic nanogratings. The proposed hybrid nanostructure can open
  new possibilities in different fields such as surface-enhanced Raman
  scattering (SERS), plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF), optical trapping, and
  nonlinear optics.
